# Social Media Ads Targeting Strategy Analysis

## Executive Summary:
This project analyses social media advertisement performance to understand how different demographic groups respond to campaigns. The goal is to identify the audience segments that deliver the highest engagement and conversions relative to spend, and to highlight where targeting adjustments can improve efficiency.

## Business Problem:
Marketing teams want to optimise ad spend by focusing on the right audience. However, current targeting may include age groups or genders that show high impressions and clicks but low conversions. This results in wasted spend and poor campaign efficiency. The project aims to determine:
-  Which demographic groups convert best
-  Where spend is inefficient
-  How targeting can be refined to improve ROI

## Methodology:
-  Imported the dataset from Kaggle into SQL and Python.
-  Explored campaign performance across impressions, clicks, spend, and conversions.
-  Created key metrics (CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, CPA) to compare audience groups.
-  Analysed how age, gender, and campaign interact with performance and cost.
-  Identified patterns indicating high-value vs low-value audience segments.

## Skills:
-  Data cleaning and SQL querying
-  Exploratory data analysis
-  KPI creation and interpretation
-  Audience segmentation
-  Marketing analytics concepts (CTR, CPA, conversion modelling)
-  Insight development for targeting strategy optimisation
